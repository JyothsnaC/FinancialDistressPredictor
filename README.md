Executive summary: 
The data is explored, cleansed, reduced and transformed before building the model. Different models are built on the data and the misclassification rates are compared. Cost analysis is used for assessment of the models. 
Some interesting Points:
Predictors with high influence on response variable: Revolving Utilization
The age variable is binned, as a part of data exploration.
Out of all the models, Decision tree and bootstrap forest had lowest misclassification rates.
Decision tree is chosen, because of its simplicity and ease for implementation.
